  utter_generalQ/mooring:
  - text: Maximum Vessel Length (MVL) is determined by a formula that includes body swing radius, pickup rope length and maximum swing room. The formula ensures safety for vessel occupants in the event of an emergency.
  utter_generalQ/teak_surfing:
  - text: Teak surfing is performed by a person hanging onto the swim platform (often made of teak wood) at the back of a boat while the boat is moving forward. Often swimmers will let go of the platform and body surf on the boat's wake. Although teak surfing is not illegal in some states, it is extremely dangerous due to the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning and sudden loss of consciousness resulting in death. The United States Coast Guard advises boaters not to teak surf. Please help spread this safety message and discourage teak surfing.

  # utter_not_starting:
  # - text: It’s most likely an electrical issue.Start by checking your kill switch.
  #     Shift into neutral, and examine the actual starter switch to see if it’s loose.
  #     Tighten up any retaining screws to fasten the switch back into place. If it
  #     groans without starting, it might be a poor connection or a low battery. Get
  #     these checked out, and remember to inspect, clean and replace your ignition
  #     system components
