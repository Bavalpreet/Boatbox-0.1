  utter_not_starting:
  - text: It’s most likely an electrical issue.Start by checking your kill switch.
      Shift into neutral, and examine the actual starter switch to see if it’s loose.
      Tighten up any retaining screws to fasten the switch back into place. If it
      groans without starting, it might be a poor connection or a low battery. Get
      these checked out, and remember to inspect, clean and replace your ignition
      system components
