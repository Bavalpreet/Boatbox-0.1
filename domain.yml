  utter_generalQ/mooring:
  - text: Maximum Vessel Length (MVL) is determined by a formula that includes body
      swing radius, pickup rope length and maximum swing room. The formula ensures
      safety for vessel occupants in the event of an emergency.
  utter_generalQ/teak_surfing:
  - text: Teak surfing is performed by a person hanging onto the swim platform (often
      made of teak wood) at the back of a boat while the boat is moving forward. Often
      swimmers will let go of the platform and body surf on the boat's wake. Although
      teak surfing is not illegal in some states, it is extremely dangerous due to
      the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning and sudden loss of consciousness resulting
      in death. The United States Coast Guard advises boaters not to teak surf. Please
      help spread this safety message and discourage teak surfing.
