  utter_generalQ/mooring-query:
  - text: Maximum Vessel Length (MVL) is determined by a formula that includes body
      swing radius, pickup rope length and maximum swing room. The formula ensures
      safety for vessel occupants in the event of an emergency.
  utter_generalQ/teak-surfing-query:
  - text: Teak surfing is performed by a person hanging onto the swim platform (often
      made of teak wood) at the back of a boat while the boat is moving forward. Often
      swimmers will let go of the platform and body surf on the boat's wake. Although
      teak surfing is not illegal in some states, it is extremely dangerous due to
      the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning and sudden loss of consciousness resulting
      in death. The United States Coast Guard advises boaters not to teak surf. Please
      help spread this safety message and discourage teak surfing.
  utter_generalQ/min-age-for-ski-craft-query:
  - text: You must be at least 16 years of age to operate a ski craft. That's the
      minimum requirement.
  utter_generalQ/no-of-people-towed-query:
  - text: No more than six people may be towed on one or more inflatable tubes and
      no more than two people may be towed on water skis, aquaplanes, or other devices
      from the same motorboat at the same time.
  utter_generalQ/observers-query:
  - text: When towing less than three people, there must be one observer (not including
      the operator). For three or more people being towed behind a motorboat, there
      must be two observers in addition to the operator. Observers must be a minimum
      of 13 years of age and physically able to assist the people being towed
  utter_generalQ/distance-between-watercraft-query:
  - text: You must be 150' from other boats, docks, swim rafts, mooring fields, swimmers,
      designated swimming areas, floats, and shore before traveling above headway
      speed.
  utter_generalQ/diff-bw-ski-craft-and-PWC-query:
  - text: A ski craft is defined as, less than 13' in length as manufactured, capable
      of exceeding 20 mph, and has the capacity to carry not more than the operator
      and one other person. There are additional regulations that ski craft operators
      must follow. A personal watercraft (pwc) has the capacity to carry more than
      the operator and one passenger and must follow the regulations set forth for
      a motor boat.
  utter_generalQ/headway-speed-query:
  - text: Headway speed is 6 mph or the slowest speed to travel and still maintain
      steerage.
  utter_generalQ/anchor-query:
  - text: It is legal for someone to anchor in front of a house, as water bodies over
      10 acres in size are public bodies of water.
  utter_generalQ/family-boat-query:
  - text: Check out bowriders, deck boats, or something of that nature. Family boating
      needs can be addressed by using the Boat Selector tool to learn the difference
      between various boat types.[Boat Selector tool](https://www.discoverboating.ca/buying/boatselector.aspx)
  utter_generalQ/sleep-query:
  - text: Overnight mooring is illegal in the State of NH, although it is legal to
      sleep on your boat overnight while tied to a dock when you have the landowner's
      permission. In addition, landowners must notify the Department of Environmental
      Services in writing.
  utter_generalQ/best-boat-query:
  - text: One of the terrific things about boating is that there are boats designed
      for different activities. Multi-purpose boating is a common choice for many
      boaters. In this case, boaters wish to buy a boat which will serve as a fishing,
      skiing and picnic boat.Performing a boat comparison can help to narrow down
      your search. Do you enjoy fishing on the local waterways? Are you looking for
      a boat to use for waterskiing, wakeboarding and other exciting water sports?
      Are you looking for a craft designed for family boating? Do you want a boat
      for a little of everything. You can check it here https://www.discoverboating.ca/buying/boatselector.aspx
  utter_generalQ/cost-query:
  - text: Buying a boat doesn’t have to be painful — there’s a boat for every budget.
      Boat owners are often surprised that their dream boat cost less than they’d
      expected! New boats and pre-owned boats bought at a reputable dealership can
      be financed, so you can take advantage of monthly payments. As with cars, pre-owned
      boats typically cost less than a similar new model.
  utter_generalQ/new-or-old-query:
  - text: We suggest that you shop new first. You will gain insight into which type
      of boat is best for you and the market price. You can then do a boat comparison
      on similar pre-owned models. With this information, you can zero in on your
      perfect boat!
  utter_generalQ/dealer-query:
  - text: Shop around a little... boat shows are also ideal for finding the dealer
      that suits you best. Choose a dealer who is convenient to where you’ll be using
      your boat. The dealer who goes out of his/her way to get you on the water, knowing
      you are qualified and ready to buy, should get high marks.
  utter_generalQ/license-query:
  - text: The Competency of Operators of Pleasure Craft Regulations will require all
      operators of pleasure craft fitted with a motor and used for recreational purposes
      to have proof of competency. These requirements are being phased in. All operators
      born after April 1, 1983 and all operators of craft under 4 metres in length
      must now have proof of competency. By September 15, 2009, all operators will
      be required to have proof of competency.
  utter_generalQ/best-time-query:
  - text: The best time is when you are ready! You can find a great deal on a boat
      at any time of year. Boat shows are great places to shop — you can compare boats
      from a wide variety of brands and dealers, and can often take advantage of special
      show pricing and financing offers. Just be sure you’ve done some homework and
      identified the right type of boat for your needs before you buy.
  utter_generalQ/boat-length-query:
  - text: The size of boat you choose depends on how many people will be boating with
      you and where you plan on boating. Make sure you anticipate these things accurately
      to ensure boater safety each time you’re under way. Every new boat has a "capacity
      plate" that tells you how many people you can safely have on board. If your
      choice comes down to a question of 2–4 feet in size, buy more if your budget
      allows. Doing this will allow you to keep your boat longer as your needs change.
      Choose a boat that is no more than 26-feet long if you plan on trailering to
      different waterways and marinas.
  utter_generalQ/insurance-cover-query:
  - text: It is best to have what is known as an "All Risk" policy, which will provide
      coverage for all types of losses except those specifically excluded in the policy.
      Typical exclusions may include wear and tear, gradual deterioration, marring,
      denting, scratching, animal damage, manufacturer's defects, defects in design,
      and ice and freezing.
  utter_generalQ/certified-boat-query:
  - text: Yes, be sure to look for a boat that's Transport Canada and NMMA Certified.
      NMMA Certified boats meet all applicable Transport Canada regulations as well
      as the more comprehensive standards of the American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC).
      Choosing boats with these certifications can greatly increase boater safety
      and guarantee boating fun every time you go out!
  utter_generalQ/trailering-query:
  - text: If you've never trailered a boat, there are several things you need to consider.
      First is the towing capacity of your car, truck or SUV. You can find this information
      in your vehicle's owner's manual. Generally, small family sedans are not safe
      boater options for towing, although a small, aluminum fishing boat may not present
      a problem, provided you have appropriate towing equipment installed on the car.
      Most standard pick-up trucks and SUVs can tow boats up to 25 feet, but again,
      consult your vehicle owner's manual for limitations.
  utter_generalQ/best-place-boat-store-query:
  - text: A key component of recreational boating is the question of where to keep
      your boat when you're not using it. Budget, convenience and availability play
      into the equation and should be part of any boat comparison process and pre-purchase
      family discussion. There are a couple of options you may want to consider. You
      won't find a less-expensive way to keep a boat than storing it on a trailer
      in your driveway or backyard (be sure to check your local bylaws). Another alternative
      for smaller boats is rack storage, or dry stacks. A typical rack storage facility
      keeps your boat in a covered shed filled with trailer-like cradles. For owners
      of larger boats, and owners of small boats who crave convenience, a marina slip
      is the best way to go
  utter_generalQ/boat-condition-query:
  - text: Get a qualified marine surveyor’s inspection. Surveyors will check all systems,
      as well as the hull structure and can ensure that boat maintenance has been
      upheld. Call several insurance companies in your area for recommended surveyors.
